                    "abstract": "This article argues against the doxa that Foucault's analysis of education inevitably undermines self-originating ethical intention on the part of teachers or students. By attending to Foucault's lesser known, later workâ€”in particular, the notion of â€˜biopowerâ€™ and the deepened level of materiality it entailsâ€”the article shows how the earlier Foucauldian conception of power is intensified to such an extent that it overflows its original domain, and comes to â€˜infuseâ€™ the subject that might previously have been taken as a mere effect. What emerges, accordingly, is a subject divested of â€˜traditionalâ€™, substantial, formation, located wholly on an immanent plane, and yet centrally concerned with the practice of freedom and ethical resistance. In turn, what seemed to have no place at all in the earlier Foucault becomes central: in general, active subjectivization (subjectivation) as a counter to passive subjection (assujetissement); more particularly, subjects' ongoing production and creation (via strategic decisions and localized opposition) of a new ethos, new â€˜practices of selfâ€™, and new kinds of relations. With this alternative Foucauldian position outlined, the article then focuses more particularly on the practices of education: it concludes that, instead of being rendered merely the factories of obedient behaviour, schools or colleges can be the locus for a critically-informed, oppositional micro-politics. In other words: the power-relations that (quite literally) constitute education can now be regarded, on Foucault's own terms, as being creative, â€˜enablingâ€™ and positive.",

In this context, whether the activities including drawing a triangular comparison diagram, Venn diagram, clustering, brainstorming, games, watching documentary and videos, writing journals, drawing plotline, technology integrated games and competitions etc. have positive affects on the studentsâ€™ comprehending the literary devices included in the novel is sought. In order to examine the effects of the activities on pupils learning, a curriculum project was developed so as to teach a unit in literature class via designing a concept map, curriculum project plan (description of the unit, outcome statements, the structure of activities), lesson plans and samples of studentsâ€™ works, overall evaluation plan (worksheets, quizzes, journals), description of the technology integrated and bibliography. The participants in this study were twenty-four eleventh grade high school students enrolled in Ames High School in Iowa, the USA in the second semester of 2007-2008 academic years. The data were collected through observations, interviews and samples of studentsâ€™ works. The results of the study indicated that the success and the comprehension of the pupilsâ€™ literary devices included in the novel could be developed by means of these selected classroom activities.",
